  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <<p>The Camino de Santiago. The very name evokes images of dusty trails, ancient churches, and personal discovery across the Spanish landscape. For months, the "French Way" has been calling to me, a whisper growing into a clear goal. But embarking on a 790km trek requires more than just sturdy boots; it demands meticulous planning, dedicated training, and a way to capture the experience.</p>

<p>That's where the second, unexpected pilgrimage began: learning to code.</p>

<p>Why combine these two seemingly disparate challenges? Honestly, it started practically. I wanted a central place to document my training progress, research gear, map out stages, and share my reflections. </p>

<p>A simple blog felt insufficient, and I wanted a more personalized, structured space. Building my own website seemed like the perfect solution. The only problem? I barely knew the difference between HTML and a hyperlink.</p>

<p>So, here I am, navigating two paths simultaneously. One will involve increasing my daily step count, breaking in hiking boots, and researching the best albergues. The other will involve staring intently at lines of code, asking AI about coding language, and celebrating small victories like centering a photo or getting a navigation menu to finally work.</p>

<p>This website, the one I plan to painstakingly building line by line, will be more than just a planning tool. It will be a tangible representation of this dual journey. It will host my training logs, gear reviews, reflections on the why behind this pilgrimage, and eventually, updates from the trail itself. Every element added, every bug fixed, will be like a step taken, not just in my coding education, but in my preparation for the Way of St. James.</P>

<P>So, follow along if you'd like! It might be a slightly chaotic chronicle of learning, planning, and training, but it's an honest one. Buen Camino, and happy coding!</P>
